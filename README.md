## To view the application locally:
1. Clone repo and run `yarn install`
2. `cd` into `server` and run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn start` in both `src` and `server` folders
4. Open [localhost](http://localhost:3000) to view the React App

## Key learning areas:
- PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React/Redux, Node)
- Using Axios to exchange information between Node API and React app
- Basics of JWT and using authorization tokens/middleware
